##### Inheritance Expectations and Education
<br>

Economic and demographic factors have contributed to the rising importance of inheritance flows across advanced economies. Focusing on education choices, and exploiting data on expected and realized inter-generational asset transfers in Italy, this paper uncovers a strong, positive conditional association between inheritance expectations and the pursuit of higher education. This result is corroborated by analysis on extended time periods, and driven by wealth in real estate, pointing at long-run determinants. The intention to leave a bequest, in fact, is strongly associated with having received one, or the expectation to receive one in the future, consistently with heterogeneity in dynastic altruism. Such heterogeneity lies at the core of a simple model rationalizing the empirical findings. Bequest motives and anticipated inheritances are linked through dynastic altruism, which shifts the inter-temporal trade-off associated with education and can reproduce inter-generational persistence in education, hence income -- on top of wealth itself. With a richer quantitative lifecycle model, I show that heterogeneity in long-term bequest motives quantitatively explain almost 90% of the differences in student rates across groups. Finally, I study the effect of introducing estate taxation and stregthening income support, and illustrate how removing uncertainty around education returns would nearly dissolve the link between dynastic altruism and education choices.\

##### Domestic Inequality and Global Imbalances  <font size="-0.25">

We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances for a large set of countries. A 1 percentage point increase in the share of income earned by the top 1 percent is associated with a 0.4-0.8 percentage point higher current account balance. This relation is driven by differences in saving rates but not investment. We rationalize this finding through a two-country heterogeneous agent model and show that, all else equal, capital flows from unequal to equal countries. Non-homotheticities in preferences generate higher saving rates by rich households which translate into current account surpluses under international capital mobility. The model also incorporates an explicit role for financial markets. We illustrate how financial forces can offset the effects of inequality and induce current account deficits in unequal countries such as the United States.\

##### Classical and Non-Classical Measurement Errors in Blood Pressure Measures from Understanding Society: an Estimation <font size="-0.25">  
###### (joint work with Thomas Crossley) 

In surveys, it is seldom possible to obtain the most accurate available measure of any variable of interest, given the high costs (monetary and not) associated to the necessary procedures. In the context of Understanding Society, we consider the setting of blood pressure measurements as gathered by nurses and compare them with self-taken and interviewer-taken ones. Assuming classical measurement error for nurse-taken measures and non-classical error for the other two sources, we estimate the parameters of interest through Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) in order to correct for any possible bias in measures exhibiting non-classical error.</font> <br/><br/>
