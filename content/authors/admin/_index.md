I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute, where I work under the supervision of professors Ramon Marimon and Thomas Crossley. I am currently visiting the International Monetary Fund.

My research interests include, but are not limited to, household finance, international macro, and social mobility. 

Unclear why you would do that, but you can also find me on [{{< icon name="twitter" pack="fab">}}](http://twitter.com/jan_mazza), mostly ranting about Italian politics and Juventus FC.

You can contact me at jan [dot] mazza [at] eui [dot] eu.
