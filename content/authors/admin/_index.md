I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence, where I work under the supervision of professors Ramon Marimon and Thomas Crossley.

I am currently visiting Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, within the framework of the European Doctoral Programme in Quantitative Economics. 

My research interests include, but are not limited to, household finance, macro-finance, political economy and text analysis. 

Unsure why you would do that, but you can also find me on [{{< icon name="twitter" pack="fab">}}](http://twitter.com/jan_mazza), mostly ranting about Italian politics and Juventus FC.

You can contact me at jan.mazza [at] eui.eu.
