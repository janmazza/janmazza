## Work in progress

- **Inheritance expectations and youths' educational choices in Italy** \
<font size="-1"> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Economic and demographic factors have contributed to the rising importance of inheritance flows over disposable income across advanced economies. This trend, reinforced by cultural traits and a high wealth-to-income ratio, has been particularly pronounced in a country like Italy. This paper shows for the first time how higher education, designed to be the main social leveler, is strongly affected by inheritance expectations. Through its influence on university enrollment, the anticipated transmission of wealth would thus amplify wealth inequality, further dampening inter-generational mobility. Estimated on a special edition of the Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household Income and Wealth, the conditional correlation is sizeable: individuals aged 18-25 expecting an inheritance are around 20 percentage points (approximately 50%) more likely to pursue higher education. Anticipated housing wealth appears to be the driver of this conditional association. Analysis on longer time periods confirms the results. The intention to leave a bequest is strongly associated with having received one, or the expectation to receive one in the future, consistently with the presence of heterogeneity and persistence in dynastic preferences for altruism. Such is the mechanism at the core of a 3-period toy model that rationalizes the empirical findings. The last, tentative, part presents a quantitative model with the ultimate goal of studying counterfactual scenarios. </font>

- **Unconventional monetary policy communication** <font size="-1">  (joint work with [Andrej Mijakovic](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io)) \
<ins>Abstract</ins>: Central bank communication has numerous facets.  This paper studies the role of official speeches by central bank representatives for financial market outcomes.First, we uncover the main themes discussed by central bankers combining unsupervised machine learning techniques with data on the entire universe of speeches given by Executive Board Members of the European Central Bank.  Second, we find that central bank speeches convey important information about the central bank's perceived reaction function.  Asset prices respond strongly to the content revealed in speeches, suggesting a novel channel through which central banks can influence market expectations. </font>

- **Classical and non-classical measurement errors in blood pressure measures from Understanding Society: an estimation** <font size="-1">  (joint work with Thomas Crossley) \
<ins>Abstract</ins>: In surveys, it is seldom possible to obtain the most accurate available measure of any variable of interest, given the high costs (monetary and not) associated to the necessary procedures. In the context of Understanding Society, we consider the setting of blood pressure measurements as gathered by nurses and compare them with self-taken and interviewer-taken ones. Assuming classical measurement error for nurse-taken measures and non-classical error for the other two sources, we estimate the parameters of interest through Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) in order to correct for any possible bias in measures exhibiting non-classical error.</font>
