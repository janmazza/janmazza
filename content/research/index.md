## Work in progress

- **The effect of inheritance expectations on youngsters' educational choices in Italy.** *Abstract: Italy exhibits an increasingly old population and substantial wealth, whose distribution is skewed towards the elderly. This, coupled with dismal economic growth, has translated into a growing flow of bequests over household disposable income. At the same time, both Italian higher education rate and the associated skill-premium are among the lowest of advanced economies. Could inheritance expectations play a role in youths' educational choices? I first investigate this empirically, relying on the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) by the Bank of Italy. I document how expecting an inheritance, even after controlling for many relevant variables at household and individual level, is associated with higher likelihood of attending university. Individuals aged 18-25 expecting an inheritance are some 20 percentage points (approximately 50\%) more likely to pursue higher education. Expected housing wealth appears to be the driver of this conditional association. These findings survive to a series of robustness checks. I then propose a toy-model to rationalize them. The medium-term goal is to propose a fully-fledged partial equilibrium model in order to be able to study some counterfactual scenarios and establish the relevance of the different channels at play.*


- **Unconventional monetary policy communication** (joint work with [Andrej Mijakovic](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io)) 
*Abstract: Central bank communication has numerous facets.  This paper studies the role of official speeches by central bank representatives for financial market outcomes.First, we uncover the main themes discussed by central bankers combining unsupervised machine learning techniques with data on the entire universe of speeches given by Executive Board Members of the European Central Bank.  Second, we find that central bank speeches convey important information about the central bank's perceived reaction function.  Asset prices respond strongly to the content revealed in speeches, suggesting a novel channel through which central banks can influence market expectations.*

- **Classical and non-classical measurement errors in blood pressure measures from Understanding Society: an estimation** (joint work with Thomas Crossley) 
*Abstract: In surveys, it is seldom possible to obtain the most accurate available measure of any variable of interest, given the high costs (monetary and not) associated to the necessary procedures. In the context of Understanding Society, we consider the setting of blood pressure measurements as gathered by nurses and compare them with self-taken and interviewer-taken ones. Assuming classical measurement error for nurse-taken measures and non-classical error for the other two sources, we estimate the parameters of interest through Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) in order to correct for any possible bias in measures exhibiting non-classical error.*
