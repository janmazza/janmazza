- **Inheritance expectations and youths' educational choices in Italy** 
  - <font size="-1"> <ins>Abstract</ins>: Economic and demographic factors have contributed to the rising importance of inheritance flows over disposable income across advanced economies. This trend, reinforced by cultural traits and a high wealth-to-income ratio, has been particularly pronounced in Italy. This paper shows for the first time how higher education is strongly, positively associated with inheritance expectations. Through its influence on university enrollment, the anticipated transmission of wealth would thus amplify inequality, further dampening inter-generational mobility. The estimated conditional correlation is sizeable: individuals aged 18-25 expecting an inheritance are around 20 percentage points (approximately 50%) more likely to pursue higher education. Anticipated housing wealth appears to be the driver of this conditional association. Analysis on longer time periods confirms the results. The intention to leave a bequest is strongly associated with having received one, or the expectation to receive one in the future, consistently with the presence of heterogeneous dynastic preferences for altruism. Such is the mechanism at the core of a 3-period toy model that rationalizes the empirical findings. The last, tentative, part presents a quantitative model with the ultimate goal of
studying counterfactual scenarios. </font>


- **Domestic inequality and global imbalances** <font size="-1">  (joint work with [Andrej Mijakovic](https://andrejmijakovic.github.io)) 
  - <ins>Abstract</ins>: We document that higher income inequality is associated with higher current account balances for a large set of countries. A 1 percentage point increase in the share of income earned by the top 1 percent is associated with a 0.4-0.8 percentage point higher current account balance. This relation is driven by differences in saving rates but not investment. We rationalize this finding through a two-country heterogeneous agent model and show that, all else equal, capital flows from unequal to equal countries. Non-homotheticities in preferences generate higher saving rates by rich households which translate into current account surpluses under international capital mobility. The model also incorporates an explicit role for financial markets. We illustrate how financial forces can offset the effects of inequality and induce current account deficits in unequal countries such as the United States. </font>


- **Classical and non-classical measurement errors in blood pressure measures from Understanding Society: an estimation** <font size="-1">  (joint work with Thomas Crossley) 
  - <ins>Abstract</ins>: In surveys, it is seldom possible to obtain the most accurate available measure of any variable of interest, given the high costs (monetary and not) associated to the necessary procedures. In the context of Understanding Society, we consider the setting of blood pressure measurements as gathered by nurses and compare them with self-taken and interviewer-taken ones. Assuming classical measurement error for nurse-taken measures and non-classical error for the other two sources, we estimate the parameters of interest through Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) in order to correct for any possible bias in measures exhibiting non-classical error.</font> <br/><br/>
