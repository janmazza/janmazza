  description: "I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute, where I work under the supervision of professors Ramon Marimon and Thomas Crossley, and a Research Fellow at the University of Bologna. At the moment I am visiting Pompeu Fabra University.
<br>
<br>
My research interests include, but are not limited to, inter-generational inequality, household finance, international macro, and health. 
<br>
<br>
Here, you can find my <a href=/resume.pdf>CV</a>, my <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sbrAYfUAAAAJ&hl=it>Google Scholar</a> and my <a href = https://github.com/janmazza>Github</a> profiles. Unclear why you would do that, but you can also find me on <a href=http://twitter.com/jan_mazza>Twitter/X</a>, mostly ranting about Italian politics and Juventus FC.

You can contact me at jan[dot]mazza[at]eui[dot]eu."

#     I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
#     full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
#     good for all of you.
#     </p>
#     <p class="lead">
#     My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
#     leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
#     talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
